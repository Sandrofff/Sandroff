<p>This article describes a style of coding in Python that permits easy mixing of
synchronous and asynchronous code. As part of the control software for large
microwave telescopes (including the <a class="reference external" href="https://pole.uchicago.edu/spt/">South Pole Telescope</a>), we have been
using this style of code under a Tornado / Python 2.x stack with success.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, architectural changes in Python 3.7 conspire against the
<cite>&#64;tworoutine</cite>.  In the hopes of contributing to a lively discussion about
Python's asynchronous ecosystem, we describe why they have been so useful to
us.</p>

<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id2">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>Asynchronous coding in Python was pioneered by third-party libraries like
<a class="reference external" href="https://twistedmatrix.com">Twisted</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://tornadoweb.org">Tornado</a>, and <a class="reference external" href="https://gevent.org">gevent</a>. An &quot;official&quot; event-loop implementation
landed in <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/asyncio-task.html">Python 3.4</a>, and was expanded
significantly in <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html">Python 3.7</a>. A new breed of asynchronous
libraries like <a class="reference external" href="http://github.com/dabaez/curio">curio</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://trio.readthedocs.io">trio</a> continue to push the boundaries beyond
what's &quot;normal&quot; in the space.</p>
<p>There are also some excellent (and opinionated) articles about Python's
asynchronous ecosystem. I don't always agree with them and I don't intend to
recapitulate them.  To allow me to get the point, though, I will provide a few
links that set the stage for what follows.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3156/">PEP 3156 -- Asynchronous IO Support Rebooted: the &quot;asyncio&quot; Module</a></li>

<li><a class="reference external" href="https://hackernoon.com/controlling-python-async-creep-ec0a0f4b79ba">Controlling Python Async Creep</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Of these, the last one is probably the most interesting because it identifies
and attempts to address the same problem we run into when designing telescope
tuning software: asynchronous and synchronous coding styles occupy different
universes in Python, but it is exteremly useful to mix them freely.</p>
<p>To motivate mixing synchronous and asynchronous code, here is a short
description of the kind of code we write for tuning telescopes.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="coding-for-telescopes">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id3">Coding for Telescopes</a></h2>
<p>My day job includes work on CMB telescopes including the <a class="reference external" href="https://pole.uchicago.edu/spt/">South Pole
Telescope</a> in <a class="reference external" href="https://goo.gl/maps/SNnrUyLcFkq">Antarctica</a> and the <a class="reference external" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.07299">Simons
Array</a> on Chile's Atacama Plateau.</p>
<p>The <a class="reference external" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1407.3161">readout electronics</a> in these
telescopes is a large array of <a class="reference external" href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1008.4587.pdf">software defined radios</a>, with many thousands of transmitters
and receivers used to bias and measure the leftover signature of the Big Bang.
These radios are implemented in hundreds of custom boards hosting <a class="reference external" href="https://www.xilinx.com/products/silicon-devices/fpga/kintex-7.html">FPGAs</a>
installed in crates near the telescope, and controlled by a PC.  This PC gets
the system up and running, controls cryogenic refrigerators, aims the
telescope, and captures the torrent of data it produces.</p>
<p>The entire tuning, control, and analysis stack makes very heavy use of Python,
along with C, C++, and VHDL. (I am inexpressibly grateful to the many
open-source communities we rely on, and it is a great privilege when I can give
back in some capacity.)</p>
<p>As you can imagine, we don't just deploy code straight onto the telescope.
Along with the telescopes themselves are small-scale installations ranging from
a circuit board or two on a benchtop, to crates of cryogenic equipments at
university labs around the world. During development, code might be running
in a <a class="reference external" href="http://jupyter.org/">Jupyter notebook</a> or an <a class="reference external" href="https://ipython.org/">IPython shell</a>, perhaps with a small crate of electronics or nothing
at all. Here, interactive REPL sessions are used to prototype algorithms,
explore data, and try out new tuning and analysis techniques.</p>
<p>For an algorithm to be useful in deployment, however, it needs to run at scale.
Here's where we use asynchronous code heavily: command interactions with many
hundreds of circuit boards are a natural fit for asynchronous coding styles.
This leads to the following workflow:</p>
<div class="figure align-center">
<img alt="" src="/images/tworoutine/separate_design_flow.png" />
<p class="caption">Design flow, with separate asynchronous/synchronous implementations:</p>
<div class="legend">
<ul class="simple">
<li>Prototype code, probably synchronous and focused on proofing out an
algorithm or technique;</li>
<li>Test for function on a small-scale deployment, likely in an interactive
(ipython) environment;</li>
<li><em>Re-code</em> the algorithm using an asynchronous style; and</li>
<li>Integration testing, optimization, and deployment.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<p>This approach has advantages:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>When developing a proof-of-concept, developers are able to ignore
performance and focus on the problem (physics, instrumentation, cryogenics,
electronics) that they are attempting to address.</li>
<li>During prototyping, when interactive exploration is most useful, synchronous
code promotes use of environments such as IPython or Jupyter.</li>
</ol>
<p>However, this workflow has three major disadvantages:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>It's clumsy: it requires writing and testing a synchronous version, then
shifting it wholesale to an asynchronous environment.  It is easy to imagine
this workflow looping back on itself as bugs are discovered or introduced
along the way.</li>
<li>The synchronous version <em>never stops being useful</em>, despite not scaling to
telescope-level performance. We would often much rather have the simpler
semantics, more predictable control flow, and shorter error traces associated
with a synchronous call when debugging or experimenting.  In addition, it can
be conveniently invoked in a REPL environment -- invaluable if the telescope is
operating and we need to do some quick hand-tuning.</li>
<li>It's not composable. Over the years, we have build up libraries of useful
tuning and control algorithms, and as long as synchronous and asynchronous
code is kept distinct, we cannot meaningfully compose algorithms out of
smaller pieces without two implementations of everything.</li>
</ol>
<p>Asking developers to maintaining two versions under different coding idioms
(and expecting to keep the versions synchronized) is resolving a technical flaw
by requiring skilled labourers to do menial work; this is often an expensive
mistake.  (Interactive use of asynchronous code is getting easier in IPython
7.0 due to the <a class="reference external" href="https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/interactive/autoawait.html">autoawait</a>
functionality. This extension addresses the second but not the third point.)</p>
<p>Instead, we are looking for a way to freely mix asynchronous and synchronous
coding styles.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="enter-the-tworoutine">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id4">Enter the <cite>&#64;tworoutine</cite></a></h2>
<p>What's a <cite>&#64;tworoutine</cite>? It is a <em>synchronous</em> wrapper around an <em>asynchronous</em>
function, allowing a single piece of code to be called in either idiom.</p>
<p>(If you are following along at home, you will need the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/gsmecher/tworoutine">source code</a>. You will also need <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/erdewit/nest_asyncio">nest_asyncio</a>.)</p>
<pre class="code python literal-block">

<span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">asyncio</span>

<span class="nd">&#64;tworoutine.tworoutine</span>
<span class="n">async</span> <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">double_slowly</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">):</span>

    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="n">x</span>
</pre>
<p>How can we call this function synchronously? Just call it!</p>
<pre class="code python literal-block">
<span class="o">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="n">double_slowly</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="mi">2</span>
</pre>
<p>How did this work? The <cite>&#64;tworoutine</cite> decorator returns a class whose <cite>__call__</cite>
method is a synchronous wrapper that obtains an event loop and invokes the
asynchronous code, blocking until it's complete. Because we want synchronous
calling to be convenient and carpal-tunnel-friendly, that's the default.</p>
<p>If there's already an event loop running, this code is reasonably efficient
(aside from being a blocking call, of course!) Any asynchronous events already
queued in the event loop are allowed to proceed alongside this one. Only the
current execution context is blocked until the coroutine completes.</p>
<p>So much for synchronous calls. How can we call this function asynchronously? We
first have to undo or &quot;invert&quot; the wrapper and obtain a reference back to the
coroutine.</p>
<pre class="code python literal-block">
<span class="o">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="o">~</span><span class="n">double_slowly</span><span class="p">)(</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">coroutine</span> <span class="nb">object</span> <span class="n">double_slowly</span> <span class="n">at</span> <span class="mh">0x7f5d494fd348</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>
</pre>
<p>With the exception of the invert operator around the function name, this is
ordinary asynchronous code; there is no additional overhead except for the
operator itself.  Here is a complete example showing mixed coding styles within
an event loop:</p>
<pre class="code python literal-block">
<span class="n">async</span> <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">main</span><span class="p">():</span>
    <span class="c1"># Run asynchronously</span>
    <span class="n">r</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">await</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="o">~</span><span class="n">double_slowly</span><span class="p">)(</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">r</span><span class="p">)</span>

    <span class="c1"># Run synchronously within an event loop</span>
    <span class="n">r2</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">double_slowly</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">r2</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="c1"># try asynchronous entry</span>
<span class="n">asyncio</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">run</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">main</span><span class="p">())</span>
</pre>
<p>The obvious benefit, here, is the ability to call asynchronous code
synchronously when we're too lazy to carry around an event loop or deal with
the <a class="reference external" href="https://medium.com/&#64;davealexis/this-is-why-i-consider-the-async-await-pattern-to-be-like-a-virus-e029d95fcba1">turtles-all-the-way-down</a>
nature of Python's asynchronous coding idiom.</p>

<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id5">A Lament: Of Course There's A Catch</a></h2>
<p><cite>&#64;tworoutine</cite>'s days are probably numbered. This style of coding has been
implicitly but firmly rejected by Python developers:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://bugs.python.org/issue22239">Issue 22239: asyncio: nested event loop</a></li>
</ul>
<p>We have been using this approach (implemented on Python 2.7 and Tornado &lt;4.5)
for several years now at the South Pole and elsewhere, and we will have to
adapt.</p>
<p>To complete a synchronous <cite>&#64;tworoutine</cite> call, we need to obtain an event loop,
schedule the asynchronous (decorated) call, and block until it is complete.
Currently there is no way to do that in Python 3.7 asyncio without patching it.
Asynchronous code at any point in the call stack must be linked to the event
loop via asynchronous calls only, all the way up.</p>
<p>To work around this problem in the Python 3.7 code shown here, I have used the
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/erdewit/nest_asyncio">nest_asyncio</a> monkey patch. It is a
short and effective piece of code, but it runs against Python orthodoxy and
adopting this kind of patch in production risks being stranded by changes to
Python's core libraries.</p>
<p>Without this patch, we are able to upgrade as far as Tornado 4.5 on Python 3.x,
but <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/issues/3397">Tornado 5.0</a> moves to
an asyncio event loop and we are suddenly unable to upgrade.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="disclaimer">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id6">Disclaimer</a></h2>
<p>The code examples here have been forward-ported from Python 2.7 and Tornado 4.5
to Python 3.7 and &quot;pure&quot; asyncio. It's an experiment -- this is not
production code!</p>
